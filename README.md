**MomentumX** is a **zero-copy shared memory IPC** library for building complex data pipelines for handling large, high-throughput datasets using **Python**. 

### Key Features:
- Supports **streaming and synchronous** modes for use within a variety of use cases. 
- Works with other high-performance libraries, such as **numpy** and **scipy**, to support memory-intensive scientific computing.
- Works on all versions of Linux using shared memory via `/dev/shm`, and seamlessly integrates into a **Docker** environment with minimal configuration.
