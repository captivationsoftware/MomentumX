**MomentumX** is a **zero-copy shared memory IPC** library for building complex **streaming data pipelines** for handling **large datasets** using **Python**. 

### Key Features:
- Sane data protections to ensure reliability of data in a cooperative computing environment. 
- Bring your own encoding, or use raw binary data.
- Supports **streaming and synchronous** modes for use within a variety of use cases. 
- Works with other high-performance libraries, such as **numpy** and **scipy**, to support parallel processing of memory-intensive scientific data.
- Works on all versions of Linux using shared memory via `/dev/shm`, and seamlessly integrates into a **Docker** environment with minimal configuration.
